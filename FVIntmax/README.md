## Formal verification of the Intmax protocol in Lean

This repository mechanises the main result (`theorem 1`) of [0].
This subsumes all of the relevant definitions and lemmas from the paper.

### Assumptions / Trust base

Strictly technically speaking, the statements we mechanically prove come with a set of assumptions that we merely assume to hold.
These are as follows.

#### Axioms

We introduce the following axioms:
`Wheels/Wheels.lean` - `axiom computationallyInfeasible_axiom : ∀ {p : Prop}, ComputationallyInfeasible p → ¬p`

To model the semantics of computational infeasibility; this technically makes the environment inconsistent;
as such, we make sure to disallow Lean to use this reasoning in any automated way whatsoever in addition
to restricting our own usage of this statement to the least degree possible.

This is used to show that the hash function we use is injective (cf. `theorem injective_of_CryptInjective`) as well as
expressing the fact that the binding property of the authenticated dictionary cannot be broken (cf. `computationallyInfeasible_axiom` in the proof of `theorem 1`).

#### Assumptions

`AttackGame.lean` defines `isπ` which is subsequently assumed by `theorem1`, in spite of this being provable from the model
of the attack game.

#### Model

We took great care to follow the definitions laid out in the paper to the maximum extent possible.
Nevertheless, the correctness of the statements being proved is with regards to the Lean definitions
mechanised in this formalisation, which are only as faithful to the ones presented in the paper
as we can reasonably ascertain as human beings.

#### Lean

We trust Lean to check the correctness of proofs.

### Building / Proof checking

Using `leanprover/lean4:v4.14.0-rc2` we simply run `lake build` in the root directory.
Successful compilation of this project means that Lean has checked the proofs of the pertinent statements.
