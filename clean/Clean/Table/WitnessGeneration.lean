  Build an index map for auxiliary cells from vars of `CellAssignment` to the cells in a trace row.
  The rule is that the auxiliary cells are appended to the end of the row in order.
  For example: [input<0>, aux<0>, input<1>, input<2>, aux<1>] => {1: 3, 4: 4}

  Given a trace row, compute the next row in the trace, which includes the auxiliary values.
  The computation logic is obtained from the `TableConstraint` witness generators, each of which
  represents a witness variable corresponding to the `vars` in the `CellAssignment`.

  Mapping for auxiliary columns:
  - The auxiliary cells' mapping from the `CellAssignment` to the aux columns in the trace row
  is done using the `buildAuxMap` function.
  - The generated witnesses are assigned to the corresponding aux columns in next trace row.

  Mapping for input columns:
  - According to `CellAssignment` for input cells, the input columns are assigned to
  the corresponding columns in the trace row.

  Generates a trace of length n, starting from the given row.

  Returns an array of rows where each subsequent row is generated using the
