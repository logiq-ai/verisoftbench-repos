## Contributing to ArkLib

We enthusiastically welcome contributions to ArkLib!

Whether you are fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new formalizations, your input is valuable. We particularly encourage contributions that address:

* **Active formalizations:** Please see the list of active formalization efforts and their blueprints.
* **Open Issues:** Please see the list of open issues for bugs, requested features, and specific formalization tasks. Issues tagged as `good first issue` or `help wanted` are great places to start.
* **Roadmap Goals:** We maintain a [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) outlining the planned direction and major goals for the library.
* **Documentation:** Documentation is actively being worked and will be available as soon as possible.

If you are interested in contributing but unsure where to begin, please get in touch.

### Large Contributions

For substantial contributions, such as a new proof system, we strongly encourage the development of a [blueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint) first.

* **What is a Blueprint?** A blueprint is a document that outlines:
    * The contents of the formalization.
    * The proposed formalization strategy in Lean (key definitions, theorems, assumptions).
    * A dependency graph relating all intermediate results to the final desired result.
    * References to relevant literature.
    * Potential challenges and design choices.
* **Why a Blueprint?** This helps align the contribution with the project's structure and goals *before* significant coding and proving effort is invested. It facilitates discussion and feedback from maintainers and the community. It also makes it easier to manage large efforts in a distributed way.
* **Process:** Please open a new discussion or issue to propose your planned contribution and discuss the blueprint before starting implementation.

## Pull Request Guidelines

We follow the specific convention for pull request titles and descriptions used by the Lean community.

### Title Format
The title should follow the format:
```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:**
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `doc`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
* `refactor`: Code refactoring
* `test`: Adding missing tests
* `chore`: Maintenance
* `perf`: Performance improvements
* `ci`: CI workflow changes

**Subject:**
* Use imperative, present tense ("change" not "changed" or "changes").
* Do not capitalize the first letter.
* No dot (.) at the end.

### Description
The description should include:
* Motivation for the change.
* Contrast with previous behavior.
* References to issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## Style and Naming Guidelines
We aim to adhere to the [Lean community's contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/tree/lean4/templates/contribute).
Our [linting script](`./scripts/lint-style.sh`) helps enforce some aspects of these guidelines.

### Naming Conventions

* **Files**: `UpperCamelCase.lean` (e.g., `BinarySearch.lean`).
* **Types and Structures**: `UpperCamelCase` (e.g., `MonoidHom`, `Visualizer`).
* **Functions and Terms**: `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `binarySearch`, `isPrime`).
* **Theorems and Proofs**: `snake_case` (e.g., `add_comm`, `list_reverse_id`).
* **Acronyms**: Treat as words (e.g., `HtmlParser` not `HTMLParser`).
* **Prop-valued Classes**: Use `UpperCamelCase`. If the class is an adjective, use the `Is` prefix (e.g., `IsCompact`, `IsPrime`). If it is a noun, no prefix is needed (e.g., `Group`, `TopologicalSpace`).
* **Spelling**: Use American English for declaration names (e.g., `analyze` not `analyse`, `color` not `colour`).
* **Dot Notation**: Use namespaces to group related definitions (e.g., `List.map`). This enables dot notation (e.g., `l.map f`) when the type is known. Use manual dot notation for logical connectives and equality (e.g., `And.intro`, `Eq.refl`, `Iff.mp`).
* **Axiomatic Names**: Use standard names for properties: `refl`, `symm`, `trans`, `comm`, `assoc`, `inj` (injective), `congr`.
* **Identifiers**: 
    * Use namespaces for logical properties (e.g., `And.comm`, `Or.intro`).
    * Use descriptive names for arithmetic/algebraic properties (e.g., `mul_comm`, `add_assoc`).

### Theorem Naming Logic

* **Hypotheses**: Use `_of_` to separate hypotheses, listed in the order they appear (e.g., `lt_of_succ_le` means "less than *follows from* successor less equal").
* **Variants**: Use `left` or `right` to describe which argument changes or is relevant (e.g., `add_le_add_left`).
* **Structural Lemmas**:
    * `ext`: For extensionality (`∀ x, f x = g x → f = g`).
    * `iff`: For bidirectional implications.
    * `inj` / `injective`: For injectivity results.
    * `mono` / `antitone`: For monotonicity.
* **Induction/Recursion**:
    * `induction_on` / `recOn`: Use when the value comes before the constructions (motive eliminates to Prop / Type).
    * `induction` / `rec`: Use when the constructions come before the value.
* **Predicates**: Generally use prefixes (e.g., `isClosed_Icc` not `Icc_isClosed`). Exceptions include property suffixes like `_inj`, `_mono`, `_injective`, `_surjective`.

### Variable Conventions

* `u`, `v`, `w`, ... : Universes
* `α`, `β`, `γ`, ... : Generic types
* `a`, `b`, `c`, ... : Propositions
* `x`, `y`, `z`, ... : Elements of a generic type
* `h`, `h₁`, ...     : Assumptions/Hypotheses
* `p`, `q`, `r`, ... : Predicates and relations
* `m`, `n`, `k`, ... : Natural numbers
* `i`, `j`, `k`, ... : Integers
* `s`, `t`, ...      : Sets or Lists

### Symbol Naming Dictionary

When translating theorem statements into names, we use standard mappings for symbols:

**Logic**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `∨` | `or` | `∧` | `and` | `¬` | `not` |
| `→` | `of` / `imp` | `↔` | `iff` | `∃` | `exists` |
| `∀` | `all` / `forall` | `=` | `eq` | `≠` | `ne` |

**Sets and Lattices**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `∈` | `mem` | `∉` | `notMem` | `⊆` | `subset` |
| `∩` | `inter` | `∪` | `union` | `\` | `sdiff` |
| `≤` | `le` | `<` | `lt` | `⊥` | `bot` |
| `⊤` | `top` | `⊔` | `sup` | `⊓` | `inf` |

**Algebra**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+` | `add` | `*` | `mul` | `^` | `pow` |
| `-` | `neg` / `sub` | `⁻¹`| `inv` | `/` | `div` |
| `∑` | `sum` | `∏` | `prod` | `•` | `smul` |

> **Note**: In adherence with mathlib, we standardize on `≤` (`le`) and `<` (`lt`). Avoid `≥` (`ge`) and `>` (`gt`) in theorem statements unless necessary for argument ordering.

### Syntax and Formatting

* **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters.
* **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* **Headers**: Use standard file headers including copyright, license (Apache 2.0), and authors.
  ```lean
  /-
  Copyright (c) 2024 Author Name. All rights reserved.
  Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.
  Authors: Author Name
  -/
  ```
* **Imports**: Group imports at the top of the file.
* **Operators**: Put spaces on both sides of `:`, `:=`, and infix operators. Place them before a line break rather than at the start of the next line.
* **Hypotheses**: Prefer placing hypotheses to the left of the colon (e.g., `(h : P) : Q`) rather than using arrows (`: P → Q`) when the proof introduces them.
* **Functions**: Prefer `fun x ↦ ...` over `λ x, ...`.
* **Instances**: Use the `where` syntax for defining instances and structures.
* **Binders**: Use a space after binders (e.g., `∀ x,` not `∀x,`).
* **Tactic Mode**: Place `by` at the end of the line preceding the tactic block. Indent the tactic block.
* **Calculations**: In `calc` blocks, align relations.
* **Empty Lines**: Avoid empty lines *inside* definitions or proofs.
* **Delimiters**: Avoid parentheses where possible. Use `<|` (pipe left) and `|>` (pipe right) to reduce nesting. Avoid using `;` to separate tactics unless writing short, single-line tactic sequences.
* **Error Messages**: In custom error or trace messages, surround interpolated data with backticks (inline) or place it on a new indented line.

### Normal Forms

We aim for consistent representations of equivalent statements:
* **Standard Forms**: Use established normal forms (e.g., `s.Nonempty` instead of `s ≠ ∅`) to enable dot notation and consistency.
* **Inequalities with Bottom/Top**:
    * In **assumptions**, use `x ≠ ⊥` (easier to check).
    * In **conclusions**, use `⊥ < x` (more powerful result).
    * Similarly for top: `x ≠ ⊤` in assumptions, `x < ⊤` in conclusions.

### Tactic Mode & Performance

* **Squeezing Simp**: Do not "squeeze" terminal `simp` calls (replacing `simp` with `simp only [...]`) unless necessary for performance or stability. Un-squeezed `simp` is often more readable and robust to minor library changes.
* **Comments**: Use `--` for inline comments and `/- ... -/` for block comments.

### Transparency and API Design

* **Definitions (`def`)**: By default, `def` creates `semireducible` definitions. These are usually not unfolded by tactics like `rw` and `simp` without explicit instruction. This is preferred for most definitions to keep terms manageable.
* **Abbreviations (`abbrev`)**: Creates `reducible` definitions that are always unfolded. Use this for type synonyms or lightweight aliases where the underlying term should be exposed.
* **Irreducible**: Use `irreducible` (or `structure` wrappers) to seal API boundaries when the internal implementation details should not leak.

### Deprecation Policy

* **Renaming**: If you rename a declaration, please ensure you fix any breakage this causes. If that is not possible, keep the old name as a deprecated alias to avoid breaking downstream code immediately.
  ```lean
  @[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")] alias oldName := newName
  ```
* **Removal**: For removals, provide a message explaining the transition.
  ```lean
  @[deprecated "Use `better_theorem` instead" (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")]
  theorem old_theorem ...
  ```

### Documentation Standards

Every definition and major theorem should have a docstring.

* **Module Docstrings**: Each file should start with a `/-! ... -/` block containing a title, summary, notation, and references.
* **Sectioning Comments**: Use `/-! ### Title -/` to structure large files into sections. These appear in the generated documentation.
* **Declaration Docstrings**: Use `/-- ... -/` above definitions.
* **Syntax**:
    * Use backticks for Lean names: `` `List.map` ``.
    * Use LaTeX for math: `$ f(x) = y $` (inline) or `$$ \sum_{i=0}^n i $$` (display).
* **Tactic Documentation**: Complete and self-contained descriptions for tactics.

### Citation Standards

When referencing papers in Lean docstrings:

* **Use citation keys in text**: Reference papers with citation keys like `[ACFY24]` rather than full titles or URLs.

* **Include a References section**: Each file that cites papers should have a `## References` section in its docstring header:
  ```lean
  ## References
  
  * [Arnon, G., Chiesa, A., Fenzi, G., and Yogev, E., *WHIR: Reed–Solomon Proximity Testing
      with Super-Fast Verification*][ACFY24]
  * [Ben-Sasson, E., Carmon, D., Ishai, Y., Kopparty, S., and Saraf, S., *Proximity Gaps
      for Reed-Solomon Codes*][BCIKS20]
  ```
  Format: `* [Author Last Name, First Initial, *Title*][citation_key]`.

* **Add BibTeX entries**: All academic papers must have entries in `blueprint/src/references.bib`. When adding a new paper, add the BibTeX entry, use the citation key in your Lean file, and list it in the References section.

* **Non-academic references**: Implementation references (GitHub repos, specifications) may include URLs directly and typically don't need BibTeX entries.
