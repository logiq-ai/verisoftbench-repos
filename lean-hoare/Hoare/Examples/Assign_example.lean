#reduce [stmt| X == 1].subst "X" [nexpr| X + 1]

-- This fails! There's another problem we have, namely that we're comparing syntactic equality of stmts, not their semantics.
example : [stmt| X == 1].subst "X" [nexpr| X + 1] = [stmt| X == 2] := by

-- Ideally, this should "just" work for this to be realtively useful.
example : TripleHolds {X == 1} X := X + 1 {X == 2} := by
   apply TripleHolds.assign -- I would hope this shold "just work"
